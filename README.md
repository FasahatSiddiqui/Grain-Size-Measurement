# Grain-Size-Measurement
The designed GCM alorithm allows the user to draw boundary of all grains in one go. Next, it automatically measures size and equivalent diameter and save results in .csv format.

A GSM.exe format file is uploded to measure grain size without installing python and its packages.


# Steps for grain size measurement

1/- Open the microscopic image file and view the original size image size on the first screen. Next, the second screen opens that shows its preview at 75% to get the scale of the microscopic image.
